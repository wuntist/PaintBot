# PaintBot

The first ever non-exploit PaintBot, Written in python (Soon replacing with Mojo ðŸ”¥) by wuntist.
Originally made as something that was going to be set aside in favor of GGBot turned into a HUGE Project.

**DISCLAIMER:** I AM NOT LIABLE FOR ANYTHING DRAWN WITH THIS, I AM SIMPLY OPEN-SOURCING IT FOR THE BENEFIT OF BLOCKATE.

## How It Works

### Image recognition

It uses a image recognition system to read the rgb values and sends them to the paint system

### Paint System

This consists of 3 Parts:

- *Color Set* (Finds the appropriate color to paint)
- *Select Color* (Selects the color)
- *Color Pixel* (Colors it)

## Optimizations

This is optimized to run at a drawing speed of 20 Blocks/s (may improve)

This also has a system to detect duplicate colors and previous image colors so it maxes out efficiency.

## Features

### Paint Image

Paints a inputted image

### AI Draw

Generates a random image for the bot to paint
